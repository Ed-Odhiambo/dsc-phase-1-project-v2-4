# BOX OFFICE ANALYSIS FOR SUCCESSFUL VENTURES TO MOVIE PRODUCTION

## AUTHOR: JOEL OMONDI

## Project Overview

This section covers a summary of what the project has tackled. It covers the __business problem__ that the project is researching together with a brief analysis of the data sources and the methods of analysis used. This section also goes into what methods have been used to handle the data and what results, insights and recommendations were able to be determined.

## Business Understanding

This section focuses on the __business problem__ you are trying to solve and what related questions can help you find the best solution to solve the said problems. It covers the business points that may lead to the __business questions__ which would direct to strategies that solve these problems. The determinants to the problem statement and questions as well as solutions that can be used to solve them. The questions are used to determine the steps and strategies that the business can use to solve their business problem.

## Data Understanding

This section seeks to understand the data and the _modifications_ that have been done to the data for the sake of understanding and analyzing the data. Questions are asked about where the data came from and how it will help with the analysis that will answer the questions for the data analysis questions.

It also seeks to understand the data and what are target variables and where they come from. What are their properties and what are their types. What wil the overall data represent in the project. This section seeks to understand what the data represents and what variables are included. An example is what the columns represent and how are their variables important. Can we use the columns from __The Numbers__ data source with variables in dollars. Can they be used as they are or they will need to be _transformed?_. These are some of the questions that need to be answered in this section.

## Data Analysis

### Data Preparatio

In this section, we analyze the data and get insights on what is happening and what can be done in order to better understand the data in a more accurate manner. Here we are going to use python language to work on our data and use methods for checking for duplicates and dropping said duplicates using the __.drop()__ method. The transforming of columns so that iterations can be done using the __.replace()__ and __.astye()__ methods.

We used python libraries such as __pandas__, __numpy__, __seaborn__ and __matplotlib__ to be able to read the raw data and present it in tabular form, to be able to analyze the rows and columns of the data as well as to find specific values that can be used to interpret different findings in the data.

### Data Modeling

This section is where the analyzed data is visualized represented using graphs through the __matplotlib__ and __seaborn__ libraries. These help to show visual representations of the analysis in a non-technical manner. This enables even those who may not understand the technical means used for analysis to be able to see for themselves and make inferences on what the analysis results have portrayed. It is a useful tool in the explanation of the project to people like investors and board members.

## Evaluation

This section involves an evaluation of what has been done and what it represents. This section contains details of the evaluation of the data. They contain insights into what has been observed and what the data represents from the results obtained. These can be used to provide recommendations to the company. It also talks about how well the model was used to evaluate the data.

## Conclusion

### Recommendations

This section contains the recommendations provided to the business, and the conclusions I have come up with in order to solve the problem questions.

#### Limitations

The statistical methods and analysis may not have been done to completion or using the best methods and would be improved upon whn needed at a future time.

#### Next Steps

This section talks about what can be done later to improve upon the project
